Write a program which uses concepts mentioned in slide 1 to find the places Fogg visited during his journey. Fetch the latitude and longitude of those places and plot them on a map of the world. Make the process as automated as you can. Try to create a single program that accepts a text file and outputs data (or maybe even a visualization).
